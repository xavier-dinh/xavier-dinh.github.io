	    <p>My project was a clicking game in which we saved the Earth from meteors and the winner got a flower</p>
	    <p>The Score was tracked and presented at the end and if more than 5 meteors were clicked you won!</p>

	    <p>We made a game with a maze and a leaderboard in which the user inputs their name</p>

	    <p>We created a birthday cat card in which the cat does an animation and lands on a cake</p>
	    <p>The cake then explodes and the name the user inputted shows up with a happy birthday text and song!</p>
